        <p>Of course you can! Everything in this room is eatable, even I'm eatable! But that is called 'cannibalism', my dear children, and is in fact frowned upon in most societies.</p>
        <p>Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, terrific soprano! Worth at least four. Maybe 3 and a half. And did I happen to mention? He's in love with a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed. Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing tham to be joined together in holy matrimony, eh?</p>
        <p>No. If we don't have a key, we can't open whatever it unlocks, so what purpose would be served in finding whatever needs to be unlocked without first having found the key that unlocks it?</p>
        <p>Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but through an unfortunate and entirely unforseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me...poor Will was press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.</p>
        <p>Ladies! Will you please shut it? Listen to me. Yes, I lied to you. No, I don't love you. Of course it makes you look fat. I've never been to Brussels. It is pronounced 'egregious'. By the way, no, I've never met Pizzaro but I love his pies. And all of this pales to utter insignificance in light of the fact that my ship is once again gone. Savvy?</p>
